# Cardinal numbers

## Description
This is a very simple Ruby gem which gives an `Integer` a `.to_string` method, to produce a string of its English-language name. This gem works with `Integer`s up to 50 bits (less than one quadrillion, or ten to the fifteenth power).

For example:
```
1234567890.to_string
=> "one billion two hundred thirty four million five hundred sixty seven thousand eight hundred ninety"
```
